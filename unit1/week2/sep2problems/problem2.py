'''
the two code blocks are the same due to the context of the elif conditional. while the elif conditionals have
different boolean statements, they both produce the same results. in both cases, if the income is <= 10000, the first
conditional runs, and if the income is between 10000 (exclusive) and 20000 (inclusive), the second conditional runs. the
added boolean statement of "income > 10000? in the right code block is arbitrary, since it is already covered by the first
conditional.
